# armhf-packages
Softwares that I compiled on my Tinkerboard, an ARM CPU.

The packages distributed here are .deb files, meant for Ubuntu systems with armhf CPU.

The distributed softwares has their own software licenses that allows me to distribute compiled version.

There's no gurantee that the files I distributed here will work on your system.

Use at your own risks.

To install .deb files, use `sudo dpkg -i (.deb file)`.

Hardware: Tinkerboard S
